## Access Control  \(AC\)


### AC-1 - Access Control Policy and Procedures

#### Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Develops, documents, and disseminates to organization-defined personnel or roles:

  - \[1\] An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
  - \[2\] Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls; and

- \[b\] Reviews and updates the current:

  - \[1\] Access control policy organization-defined frequency; and
  - \[2\] Access control procedures organization-defined frequency.

### AC-2 - Account Management

#### Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions: organization-defined information system account types;

- \[b\] Assigns account managers for information system accounts;

- \[c\] Establishes conditions for group and role membership;

- \[d\] Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account;

- \[e\] Requires approvals by organization-defined personnel or roles for requests to create information system accounts;

- \[f\] Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts in accordance with organization-defined procedures or conditions;

- \[g\] Monitors the use of information system accounts;

- \[h\] Notifies account managers:

  - \[1\] When accounts are no longer required;
  - \[2\] When users are terminated or transferred; and
  - \[3\] When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes;

- \[i\] Authorizes access to the information system based on:

  - \[1\] A valid access authorization;
  - \[2\] Intended system usage; and
  - \[3\] Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions;

- \[j\] Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements organization-defined frequency; and

- \[k\] Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.
